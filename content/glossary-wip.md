OBJECTIVE CARDS
Players can score objectives to gain victory points.

<!-- 61.1 -->
There are two types of objective cards: public objectives and secret objectives.
a Each public objective has a “I” or “II” on the back of its card; all other objectives are secret objectives.

<!-- 61.2 -->
Each objective card indicates a number of victory points that a player gains by scoring that objective.

<!-- 61.3 -->
Each objective card indicates the phase during which a player can score that objective—the status, action, or agenda phases.

<!-- 61.4 -->
Each objective card describes the requirement a player must fulfill to score that objective.

<!-- 61.5 -->
If a player fulfills the requirement described on an objective card, they can score that objective following the timing indicated on the card, either during the action phase or the status phase.
a When a player scores an objective during the status phase, they must fulfill the requirement on the card during the “Score Objectives” step of the status phase to score that objective.
b When a player scores an objective during the action phase, they can do so at any time during that phase.
c When a player scores an objective during the agenda phase, they can do so at any time during that phase.

<!-- 61.6 -->
A player can score a maximum of one public objective and one secret objective during each status phase.

<!-- 61.7 -->
A player can score any number of objectives during the agenda phase or during a turn of the action phase; however, they can only score one objective during or after each combat.
a A player can score an objective during both the space combat and the ground combat during the same tactical action.

<!-- 61.8 -->
A player can score each objective only once during the game.


<!-- 61.9 -->
If an objective requires a player to destroy one or more units, those units can be destroyed by producing hits against them, playing action cards, using technology, or any number of other abilities that use the “destroy” terminology.
a Forcing a player to remove a unit from the board by reducing the number of command tokens in their fleet pool is not treated as destroying a unit.

<!-- 61.10 -->
Players can score some objectives by spending resources, influence, or tokens, as described by the objective card. To score such an objective, a player must pay the specified cost at the time indicated on the card.


<!-- 61.11 -->
PUBLIC OBJECTIVES
A public objective is an objective that is revealed to all players.

<!-- 61.12 -->
When scoring a public objective, the player places one of their control tokens on that objective’s card. Then, that player advances their control token on the victory point track a number of spaces equal to the number of victory points gained.

<!-- 61.13 -->
Each game contains five stage I and five stage II public objective cards that the speaker places facedown near the victory point track during setup.
a The speaker reveals two of the stage I objective cards during setup. All other objective cards remain facedown.

<!-- 61.14 -->
During each status phase, the speaker reveals a facedown public objective card.
a The speaker does not reveal stage II objective cards until all stage I objective cards are revealed.

<!-- 61.15 -->
If the speaker must reveal a facedown public objective card but all public objective cards are already revealed, the game ends immediately.
a The player with the most victory points is the winner. If one or more players are tied for having the most victory points, the tied player who is first in initiative order is the winner.

<!-- 61.16 -->
A player cannot score public objectives if that player does not control each planet in their home system.


<!-- 61.17 -->
SECRET OBJECTIVES
A secret objective is an objective that is controlled by one player and is hidden from all other players until it is scored.

<!-- 61.18 -->
When scoring a secret objective, a player reveals the objective by placing it faceup in their play area. Then, they place one of their control tokens on that objective’s card and advances their control token on the victory point track a number of spaces equal to the number of victory points gained.


<!-- 61.19 -->
A player can only score their own secret objectives; a player cannot score secret objectives revealed by other players.

<!-- 61.20 -->
Each player begins the game with one secret objective.

<!-- 61.21 -->
Each player can have up to three total scored and unscored secret objectives.
a If a player draws a secret objective and has more than three, that player must choose one of their unscored secret objectives and return it to the deck. Then, that player shuffles the secret objective deck.

<!-- 61.22 -->
A player can gain secret objectives by resolving either the primary or secondary ability of the “Imperial” strategy card.


<!-- 62 -->
OPPONENT
During combat, a player’s opponent is the other player that either has ships in the system at the start of the space combat or has ground forces on the planet at the start of a ground combat.

<!-- 62.1 -->
Players who do not have units on either side of a combat are not opponents. Those players cannot use abilities or have abilities used against them that are used against an opponent.


<!-- 63 -->
PDS
A PDS (planetary defense system) is a structure that allows a player to defend their territory against invading forces.

<!-- 63.1 -->
Each PDS has the “Space Cannon” ability.

<!-- 63.2 -->
The primary way by which players acquire PDS units is by resolving either the primary or secondary ability of the “Construction” strategy card.

<!-- 63.3 -->
A PDS unit is placed on a planet. Each planet can have a maximum of two PDS units.

<!-- 63.4 -->
If a player’s PDS is ever on a planet that does not contain any of their own ground forces and contains a unit that belongs to another player, that PDS is destroyed.


<!-- 64 -->
PLANETS
Planets provide players with resources and influence. Planets are on system tiles and each has a name, a resource value, and an influence
value. Some planets also have traits.

<!-- 64.1 -->
A planet’s resources are indicated by the value on its planet card and system tile that is surrounded by a yellow triangular border.


<!-- 64.2 -->
A planet’s influence is indicated by the value on its planet card and system tile that is surrounded by a blue hexagonal border.

<!-- 64.3 -->
A planet’s trait has no inherent effects, but some game effects refer to a planet’s trait. There are three traits: cultural, hazardous, and industrial.


<!-- 64.4 -->
Some planets have a technology specialty, which allows those planets to be exhausted to satisfy a prerequisite when researching technology.

<!-- 64.5 -->
Some planets are legendary planets, as indicated by the legendary planet icon. When a player gains control of a legendary planet, they also gain control of its legendary planet ability card.


<!-- 64.6 -->
PLANET CARD
Each planet has a corresponding planet card that displays its name, resource value, influence value, and trait, if it has one. If a player controls a planet, they keep that planet’s card in their play area.

<!-- 64.7 -->
A planet card has both a readied and exhausted state. When a planet is readied, it is placed faceup. When a planet is exhausted, it is placed facedown.

<!-- 64.8 -->
A player can spend a readied planet’s resources or influence.

<!-- 64.9 -->
A player cannot spend an exhausted planet’s resources or influence.


<!-- 65 -->
PLANETARY SHIELD (UNIT ABILITY)
Units cannot use the “Bombardment” ability against a planet that contains a unit that has the “Planetary Shield” ability.

<!-- 65.1 -->
The “Planetary Shield” ability does not prevent a planet from being affected by the “X-89 Bacterial Weapon” technology.

<!-- 65.2 -->
The “Planetary Shield” ability prevents an L1Z1X player from using their “Harrow” faction ability.

<!-- 65.3 -->
If a war sun is in a system with any number of other players’ units that have the “Planetary Shield” ability, those units are treated as if they do not have that ability.
a Units treated as if they do not have a “Planetary Shield” ability cannot use the “Magen Defense Grid” technology.
b A war sun can use its “Bombardment” ability against planets that contain units that have the “Planetary Shield” ability.


<!-- 66 -->
POLITICS (STRATEGY CARD)
The “Politics” strategy card allows players to draw action cards. Additionally, the active player chooses a new speaker and looks at cards in the agenda deck. This card’s initiative value is “3.”

<!-- 66.1 -->
During the action phase, if the active player has the “Politics” strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card’s primary ability.

<!-- 66.2 -->
To resolve the primary ability on the “Politics” strategy card, the active player resolves the following effects in order:
i. The active player chooses any player that does not have the speaker token. The active player may choose themselves as long as they do not have the speaker token. The chosen player places the speaker token in their play area; they are now the speaker.
ii. The active player draws two action cards.
iii.The active player secretly looks at the top two cards of the agenda deck. Then, that player places each card on either the top or the bottom of the deck. If they place both cards on either the top or bottom, they can place them in any order.

<!-- 66.3 -->
After the active player resolves the primary ability of the “Politics” strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from their strategy pool to draw two action cards.


<!-- 67 -->
PRODUCING UNITS
The primary way that a player produces new units is by resolving the “Production” abilities of existing units during a tactical action. However, other game effects also allow players to produce units.

<!-- 67.1 -->
Each unit that a player can produce has a cost value presented on its faction sheet or technology card. To produce a unit, a player must spend a number of resources equal to or greater than the cost value of the unit they are producing.
a Spent resources must come from planets or trade goods that are controlled by the player who is producing the units.
b Any resources spent in excess of a unit’s cost are lost.
c If a player is producing multiple units at a time, that player can add the cost of each unit they are producing to create a total cost before they spend any resources.

<!-- 67.2 -->
If the cost is accompanied by two icons—typically for fighters and infantry—a player produces two of that unit for that cost.
a Each of the two units counts toward the total number of units a player can produce.
b A player can choose to produce only one unit; however, they must still pay the entire cost.

<!-- 67.3 -->
When a player produces a unit through the use of their units’ “Production” abilities during a tactical action, that player follows the rules of the “Production” ability to determine where in the active system the units can be placed.

<!-- 67.4 -->
When a player produces a unit through an ability outside of the tactical action, that ability will state how many units that player can produce and where that player can place those units.
a A player cannot produce a unit on a planet they do not control.
b If an ability allows a player to produce a unit in a system, they may produce that unit in the space area or on a planet they control in that system.

<!-- 67.5 -->
A player is limited by the number of units in their reinforcements.
a If a player cannot produce a unit because it is not in their reinforcements, that player can remove a unit from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that unit in their reinforcements. Then, that player can produce that unit. A player can remove any number of their units in this way; however, any units that are removed must be produced immediately.
b When producing a fighter or infantry unit, a player can use a fighter or infantry token, as appropriate, from the supply instead of a plastic piece.

<!-- 67.6 -->
A player cannot produce ships in a system that contains other players’ ships. a Ground forces can still be produced.


<!-- 68 -->
PRODUCTION (UNIT ABILITY)
During the “Production” step of a tactical action, the active player can resolve the “Production” ability of each of their units that are in the active system to produce units.

<!-- 68.1 -->
A unit’s “Production” ability, which is presented on a faction sheet or unit upgrade technology card, is always followed by a value. This value is the maximum number of units that this unit can produce.
a If the active player has multiple units in the active system that have the “Production” ability, that player can produce a number of units up to the combined total of their units’ production values in that system.
b When producing fighters or infantry, each individual unit counts toward the producing unit’s production limit.
c A player can choose to produce one fighter or infantry instead of two, but must still pay the entire cost.
d “Production” value from Arborec space docks cannot be used to produce infantry, even if the Arborec player controls other units that have “Production” in the same system.


<!-- 68.2 -->
When a player produces ships by using “Production,” that player must place them in the active system.

<!-- 68.3 -->
When a player produces ground forces, that player must place those unit on planets that contain a unit that used its “Production” ability.

<!-- 68.4 -->
If a player uses the “Production” ability of a unit in a space area of a system to produce ground forces, those ground forces may either be placed on a planet the player controls in that system or in the space area of that system.


<!-- 69 -->
PROMISSORY NOTES
Each player begins the game with one unique and five generic promissory note cards that can be given to other players.

<!-- 69.1 -->
Each promissory note contains timing text and ability text. A player can resolve any of their promissory note cards by following the text on the card.
a Promissory notes are not mandatory unless otherwise specified.

<!-- 69.2 -->
A player cannot play their color’s or faction’s promissory notes. Since the cards are only valuable to other players, promissory notes can be traded as powerful negotiation tools.

<!-- 69.3 -->
Promissory notes that are returned to a player are returned after their abilities have been completely resolved.

<!-- 69.4 -->
If a promissory note is returned to a player, that player may give it to other players again as part of a future transaction.
a An unrevealed promissory note is not subject to effects in its ability text that return the card if certain conditions are met.

<!-- 69.5 -->
When resolving a transaction, a player can trade a maximum of one promissory note from their hand to another player, even if that card originally belonged to another player.
a Promissory notes in the play area cannot be traded.

<!-- 69.6 -->
Players should keep their hands of promissory notes hidden.

<!-- 69.7 -->
If a player is eliminated, all of the promissory notes that match their color or faction are returned to the game box, including those that are in play or owned by other players.
a Other players’ promissory notes are returned to those players.


<!-- 70 -->
PURGE
Purge is a cost that permanently removes a component from the game. If an ability requires that its component is purged, that component can only be used once per game.

<!-- 70.1 -->
If an ability instructs a player to purge a component, that component is removed from the game and returned to the box.

<!-- 70.2 -->
Purged components cannot be used or otherwise returned to the game by any means.

<!-- 70.3 -->
When a player is intructed to purge a component, that component is purged even if its ability was only partially resolved.


<!-- 71 -->
READIED
Cards have a readied state, which indicates that a player can exhaust or resolve the abilities on those cards.

<!-- 71.1 -->
A card that is readied is placed faceup in a player’s play area; a card that is exhausted is placed facedown in a player’s area.

<!-- 71.2 -->
A player can exhaust a readied planet card to spend resources or influence from that card’s planet.

<!-- 71.3 -->
A player can exhaust certain readied technology cards to resolve those cards’ abilities.
a Such a technology will specifically instruct a player to exhaust the card as part of the ability’s cost.

<!-- 71.4 -->
If a card is exhausted, a player cannot resolve that card’s abilities or spend resources or influence on that card until it is readied.

<!-- 71.5 -->
During a “Ready Cards” step, each player readies all of their exhausted cards by flipping them faceup.

<!-- 71.6 -->
When a player performs a strategic action, they exhaust their chosen strategy card.
a That card is later readied during the status phase.


<!-- 72 -->
REINFORCEMENTS
A player’s reinforcements is that player’s personal supply of units and command tokens that are not on the game board or otherwise in use.

<!-- 72.1 -->
The components in a player’s reinforcements are limited.


<!-- 73 -->
RELICS
Relics are powerful artifacts with unique abilities.

<!-- 73.1 -->
Players can use the abilities of hazardous, cultural, and industrial relic fragments in their play area to draw cards from the relic deck.
a Relic fragments can be found when exploring planets and frontier tokens, and can be exchanged with other players as part of transactions.

<!-- 73.2 -->
When a player is instructed to gain a relic, they draw the top card of the relic deck and place it faceup in their play area.
a If there are no cards in the relic deck, they do not gain a relic.

<!-- 73.3 -->
A player can use the abilities of relics that are in their play area.

<!-- 73.4 -->
Relics cannot be traded.


<!-- 74 -->
REROLLS
Some game effects instruct a player to reroll dice.

<!-- 74.1 -->
When a die is rerolled, its new result is used instead of its previous result.

<!-- 74.2 -->
The same ability cannot be used to reroll the same die multiple times, but multiple abilities can be used to reroll a single die.

<!-- 74.3 -->
Die rerolls must occur after rolling the dice, before other abilities are resolved.


<!-- 75 -->
RESOURCES
Resources represent a planet’s material value and industry. Many game effects, such as producing units, require players to spend resources.

<!-- 75.1 -->
A planet’s resources are the leftmost value that is surrounded by a yellow border on the planet’s system tile and planet card.

<!-- 75.2 -->
A player spends a planet’s resources by exhausting its card.

<!-- 75.3 -->
A player can spend a trade good as if it were one resource.


<!-- 76 -->
SHIPS
A ship is a unit type consisting of carriers, cruisers, dreadnoughts, destroyers, fighters, and war suns. Each race also has a unique flagship.

<!-- 76.1 -->
Ships are always placed in space.

<!-- 76.2 -->
A player can have a number of ships in a system equal to or less than the number of command tokens in that player’s fleet pool. a Fighters do not count toward the fleet pool limit, and instead count against a player’s capacity.

<!-- 76.3 -->
Ships can have any number of the following attributes: cost, combat, move, and capacity. These attributes are shown on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards.


<!-- 77 -->
SPACE CANNON (UNIT ABILITY)
A unit that has the “Space Cannon” ability can use it during two different steps of a player’s tactical action: after the “Move Ships” substep (Space Cannon Offense) and during an invasion (Space Cannon Defense).

<!-- 77.1 -->
A player is not required to be the active player to use their “Space Cannon” ability of their units.


<!-- 77.2 -->
SPACE CANNON OFFENSE
During a tactical action, after the “Move Ships” substep of the “Movement” step, beginning with the active player and proceeding clockwise, each player may use the “Space Cannon” ability of each of their units in the active system by performing the following steps:

<!-- 77.3 -->
STEP 1—ROLL DICE: The player rolls dice for each of their units in the active system that has the “Space Cannon” ability; this is a space cannon roll. One hit is produced for each result that is equal to or greater than the unit’s “Space Cannon” value.
a A unit’s “Space Cannon” ability is presented along with a unit’s attributes on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards.
b “Space Cannon” is displayed as “Space Cannon X (xY).” The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled. Not all “Space Cannon” abilities are accompanied by a (Y) value; a space cannon roll for such a unit consists of one die.
c If a player has a PDS unit upgrade technology, they can use the “Space Cannon” ability of their PDS units that are in systems that are adjacent to the active system. The hits are still assigned to units in the active system.
d Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect space cannon rolls.


<!-- 77.4 -->
This ability can be used even if no ships were moved during the “Move Ships” step.

<!-- 77.5 -->
STEP 2—ASSIGN HITS: The player whose units have been targeted by “Space Cannon” must choose and destroy one of their ships in the active system for each hit result produced against their units.
a Players other than the active player must target the active player’s units.
b If the active player is using the “Space Cannon” ability of their units, they choose a player who has ships in the active system. That player must choose and destroy one of their ships in the active system for each hit the space cannon roll produced.


<!-- 77.6 -->
SPACE CANNON DEFENSE
During the invasion step of a tactical action, after ground forces have been committed to land on planets, players other than the active player can resolve the “Space Cannon” ability of their units on those planets by performing the following steps:

<!-- 77.7 -->
STEP 1—ROLL DICE: Each player may use the “Space Cannon” ability of each of their units on the invaded planet by rolling a specific number of dice for each of those units; this is called a space cannon roll. A hit is produced for each die roll that is equal to or greater than the unit’s “Space Cannon” value.
a If a unit has a “Space Cannon” ability, it is present on its faction sheet and technology cards.
b “Space Cannon” is displayed as “Space Cannon X (xY).” The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled. Not all “Space Cannon” abilities are accompanied by a (Y) value; a space cannon roll for such a unit consists of one die.
c Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect space cannon rolls.
d Game effects that allow the use of “Space Cannon” abilities against ships in adjacent systems have no effect during Space Cannon Defense.


<!-- 77.8 -->
STEP 2—ASSIGN HITS: The active player must choose and destroy one of their ground forces on the planet for each hit the space cannon roll produced.
a Hits can only be assigned to units that are on the same planet as the units using the “Space Cannon” ability.


<!-- 78 -->
SPACE COMBAT
After resolving the “Space Cannon Offense” step of a tactical action, if two players have ships in the active system, those players must resolve a space combat.

<!-- 78.1 -->
If the active player is the only player with ships in the system, they skip the “Space Combat” step of the tactical action and proceeds to the “Invasion” step.

<!-- 78.2 -->
If an ability occurs “before combat,” it occurs immediately before the “Anti-Fighter Barrage” step.
a During the first round of a combat, “start of combat” and “start of combat round” effects occur during the same timing window.
b During the last round of a combat, “end of combat” and “end of combat round” effects occur during the same timing window.

To resolve a space combat, players perform the following steps:

<!-- 78.3 -->
STEP 1—ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE: If this is the first round of a space combat, the players may simultaneously use the “Anti-Fighter Barrage” ability of any of their units in the active system.
a If one or both players no longer have ships in the active system after resolving this step, the space combat ends immediately.
b Players cannot resolve “Anti-Fighter Barrage” abilities during any rounds of space combat other than the first round.
c This step still occurs if no fighters are present.

<!-- 78.4 -->
STEP 2—ANNOUNCE RETREATS: Each player may announce a retreat, beginning with the defender.
a A retreat will not occur immediately; the units retreat during the “Retreat” step.
b If the defender announces a retreat, the attacker cannot announce a retreat during that combat round.
c A player cannot announce a retreat if there is not at least one eligible system to retreat to.

<!-- 78.5 -->
STEP 3—ROLL DICE: Each player rolls one die for each ship they have in the active system; this is called a combat roll. If a unit’s combat roll produces a result that is equal to or greater than that unit’s combat value, that result produces a hit.
a If a unit’s combat value contains two or more burst icons, the player rolls one die for each burst icon instead.
b If a player has ships that have different combat values in the active system, that player rolls these dice separately.
c First, that player should roll all dice for units with a combat value of “1.” Then, that player should roll all dice for units with combat value of “2,” and then “3,” continuing in numerical order until that player has rolled dice for each of their ships.
d The player counts each hit their combat rolls produce. The total number of hits produced will destroy units during the “Assign Hits” step.
e If a player has an ability that rerolls a die or affects a die after it is rolled, that player must resolve such an ability immediately after rolling all of their dice.
f The attacker makes all of their combat rolls during this step before the defender. This procedure is important for abilities that allow a player to reroll an opponent’s die.


<!-- 78.6 -->
STEP 4—ASSIGN HITS: Each player in the combat must choose and destroy one of their own ships in the active system for each hit their opponent produced.
a Before assigning hits, players may use their units’ “Sustain Damage” abilities to cancel hits.
b When a unit is destroyed, the player who controls that unit removes it from the board and places it in their reinforcements.


<!-- 78.7 -->
STEP 5—RETREAT: If a player announced a retreat during step 2, and there is still an eligible system for their units to retreat to, they must retreat.
a If a player announced a retreat during the “Announce Retreats” step, but their opponent has no ships remaining in the system, the combat immediately ends and the retreat does not occur.
b To retreat, a player takes all of their ships with a move value in the combat and moves them to a single system that is adjacent to the active system. That player’s fighters and ground forces in the space area of the active system that are unable to move or be transported are removed.
c The system that a player’s units retreat to must contain one or more of that player’s units, a planet they control, or both. Additionally, the system cannot contain ships controlled by another player.
d If any of a player’s units successfully retreat and are moved into an adjacent system, that player must place a command token from their reinforcements in the system to which their units retreated. If that system already contains one of their command tokens, that player does not place an additional token there. If the player has no command tokens in their reinforcements, that player must use one from their command sheet instead.


<!-- 78.8 -->
After the “Retreat” step, if both players still have ships in the active system, those players resolve another round of space combat beginning with the “Announce Retreats” step.

<!-- 78.9 -->
Space combat ends when only one player—or neither player— has a ship in the space area of the active system. a During the last round of a combat, “end of combat” and “end of combat round” effects occur during the same timing window.

<!-- 78.10 -->
After a combat ends, the player with one or more ships remaining in the system is the winner of the combat; the other player is the loser of the combat. If neither player has a ship remaining, the combat ends in a draw and there is no winner.
a If the winner of the combat has fighters or ground forces in the space area of the active system and those units exceed the capacity of that player’s ships in that system, that player must choose and remove any excess units.


<!-- 79 -->
SPACE DOCK
A space dock is a structure that allows players to produce units.

<!-- 79.1 -->
Each space dock has a “Production” ability that indicates the number of units it can produce.

<!-- 79.2 -->
The primary way in which players acquire space docks is by resolving either the primary or secondary abilities of the “Construction” strategy card.

<!-- 79.3 -->
Space docks are placed on planets. Each planet can have a maximum of one space dock.

<!-- 79.4 -->
If a player’s space dock is ever on a planet that does not contain any of their ground forces and contains a unit that belongs to another player, that space dock is destroyed.
a The Clan of Saar’s “Floating Factory” faction-specific space dock is destroyed when it is blockaded; that is to say, when it is in a system with another player’s ships and none of the Clan of Saar’s ships.


<!-- 80 -->
SPEAKER
The speaker is the player who has the speaker token.

<!-- 80.1 -->
During the strategy phase, the speaker is the first player to choose a strategy card.

<!-- 80.2 -->
During the agenda phase, the speaker reveals the top agenda card from the agenda deck before each vote. The speaker is always the last player to vote and decides which outcome to resolve if the outcomes are tied.


<!-- 80.3 -->
During setup, the speaker prepares the objectives.

<!-- 80.4 -->
During the status phase, the speaker reveals a public objective.

<!-- 80.5 -->
A random player gains the speaker token during setup before the game begins.

<!-- 80.6 -->
During the action phase, if a player resolves the primary ability on the “Politics” strategy card, that player chooses any player other than the current speaker to gain the speaker token.

<!-- 80.7 -->
If the speaker is eliminated from the game, the speaker token is passed to the player to the speaker’s left.


<!-- 81 -->
STATUS PHASE
During the status phase, players score objectives and prepare for the next game round. To resolve the status phase, players perform the following steps:

<!-- 81.1 -->
STEP 1—SCORE OBJECTIVES: Following initiative order, each player may score up to one public objective and one secret objective that can be fulfilled during the status phase. To score an objective, a player must fulfill the requirements on the card; if that player does, they gain a number of victory points indicated on the card.

<!-- 81.2 -->
STEP 2—REVEAL PUBLIC OBJECTIVE: The speaker reveals an unrevealed public objective card by flipping that card faceup.
a The speaker cannot reveal “Stage II” objectives until all “Stage I” objectives are revealed.
b The game ends if there are no unrevealed public objectives at the start of this step.

<!-- 81.3 -->
STEP 3—DRAW ACTION CARDS: Following initiative order, each player draws one action card.

<!-- 81.4 -->
STEP 4—REMOVE COMMAND TOKENS: Each player removes all of their command tokens from the game board. Each player returns each removed token to their reinforcements.

<!-- 81.5 -->
STEP 5—GAIN AND REDISTRIBUTE COMMAND TOKENS: Each player gains two command tokens. A player takes each gained token from their reinforcements. Then, each player can redistribute each command token on their command sheet, including the two they just gained, among their strategy, tactic, and fleet pools.
a Players should remember to check the number of their ships in each system after reducing the size of their fleet pools.
b This step can usually be resolved simultaneously, but if there is a timing conflict, it is resolved in initiative order.


<!-- 81.6 -->
STEP 6—READY CARDS: Each player readies all of their exhausted cards, including strategy cards.

<!-- 81.7 -->
STEP 7—REPAIR UNITS: Each player repairs all of their damaged units by turning those units upright.

<!-- 81.8 -->
STEP 8—RETURN STRATEGY CARDS: Each player returns their strategy card to the common play area. Then, if a player has removed the custodians token from Mecatol Rex, the game round continues to the agenda phase. Otherwise, a new game round begins with the strategy phase.


<!-- 82 -->
STRATEGIC ACTION
During the action phase, the active player may perform a strategic action to resolve the primary ability on their strategy card.

<!-- 82.1 -->
After the active player resolves the primary ability on their strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may resolve that strategy card’s secondary ability.
a Players do not have to resolve the secondary abilities of the active player’s strategy card.

<!-- 82.2 -->
After each player has had an opportunity to resolve a strategy card’s secondary ability, the active player exhausts their strategy card so that it is facedown—this indicates that they cannot use this card again this round and is a reminder that they can now pass during one of their later turns.
a During three- and four-player games, a player must resolve the strategic action on each of their chosen strategy cards before they can pass.

<!-- 82.3 -->
When a player is resolving either the primary or secondary abilities from a strategy card, that player resolves each of the ability’s effects from top to bottom.


<!-- 83 -->
STRATEGY CARD
Strategy cards determine initiative order and provide each player with a powerful ability that they can use one time during the action phase.

<!-- 83.1 -->
During the strategy phase, each player chooses a strategy card from the common play area and places it in their play area faceup.

<!-- 83.2 -->
Each strategy card has a readied and an exhausted side.

a The readied side contains the strategy card’s name, initiative number, and abilities.
b The exhausted side contains the strategy card’s initiative number.

<!-- 83.3 -->
A player can only resolve the primary ability of their own strategy cards.

<!-- 83.4 -->
A player can only resolve the secondary ability of strategy cards that were chosen by other players.

<!-- 83.5 -->
There are eight strategy cards, each of which has a name and an initiative number.

<!-- 83.6 -->
The initiative number on a player’s strategy card determines the initiative order for the action phase and status phase.

<!-- 83.7 -->
A strategy card has both a primary ability and a secondary ability. These abilities are resolved during a strategic action.

<!-- 83.8 -->
Each strategy card exists in either the common play area or a player’s play area.
a Strategy cards in the common play area are available for players to choose during the strategy phase.
b A strategy card in a player’s play area belongs to that player until it is returned to the common play area during the status phase.


<!-- 84 -->
STRATEGY PHASE
During the strategy phase, each player chooses a strategy card to use during the round.

To resolve the strategy phase, players perform the following steps:

<!-- 84.1 -->
STEP 1—Starting with the speaker and proceeding clockwise, each player chooses one strategy card from the common play area and places it faceup in their play area.
a If there are one or more trade good tokens on a strategy card when a player chooses it, that player gains those trade goods.
b A player cannot choose a strategy card that another player has already chosen during the current strategy phase.
c When playing with three or four players, each player will choose a second strategy card. After the last player has received their first strategy card, each player chooses
a second strategy card, starting with the speaker and proceeding clockwise.

<!-- 84.2 -->
STEP 2—The speaker places one trade good token from the supply on each strategy card that was not chosen.

a During a four- or eight-player game, all strategy cards will be chosen, and therefore no trade good tokens will be placed on strategy cards. Then, players proceed to the action phase.


<!-- 85 -->
STRUCTURES
A structure is a type of unit. PDS units and space docks are structures.

<!-- 85.1 -->
Structures are always placed on planets.
a The Clan of Saar’s “Floating Factory” faction-specific space dock is placed in a system’s space area.

<!-- 85.2 -->
Structures are primarily placed on planets using the “Construction” strategy card.

<!-- 85.3 -->
Structures cannot move or be transported.

<!-- 85.4 -->
A player can have a maximum of one space dock on each planet.

<!-- 85.5 -->
A player can have a maximum of two PDS units on each planet.

<!-- 85.6 -->
A player cannot place a structure on a planet if it would exceed the maximum number of allowed structures of that type on that planet.


<!-- 86 -->
SUPERNOVA
A supernova is an anomaly that affects movement.

<!-- 86.1 -->
A ship cannot move through or into a supernova.


<!-- 87 -->
SUSTAIN DAMAGE (UNIT ABILITY)
Some units have the “Sustain Damage” ability. Immediately before a player assigns hits to their units, that player can use the “Sustain Damage” ability of any of their units in the active system.

<!-- 87.1 -->
For each “Sustain Damage” ability that a player uses, one hit produced by another player’s units is canceled. Then, each unit using this ability is placed on its side to indicate that it is damaged.

<!-- 87.2 -->
A damaged unit does not have reduced capabilities and is functionally the same as an undamaged unit, except that it cannot use the “Sustain Damage” ability.

<!-- 87.3 -->
A damaged unit cannot use the “Sustain Damage” ability until it is repaired during the status phase or by another game effect.


<!-- 87.4 -->
A unit can use its “Sustain Damage” ability any time a hit is produced against it. This includes hits produced during combat and from unit abilities such as the “Space Cannon” ability.
a A unit can only use the “Sustain Damage” ability if it is eligible to be hit. For example, a player cannot use a dreadnought’s “Sustain Damage” ability to cancel a hit from “Anti-Fighter Barrage.”

<!-- 87.5 -->
The “Sustain Damage” ability cannot be used to cancel an effect that directly destroys a unit.

<!-- 87.6 -->
The Barony of Letnev’s “Non-Euclidean Shielding” faction technology allows the Letnev player’s units with the “Sustain Damage” ability to cancel up to two hits instead of one.


<!-- 88 -->
SYSTEM TILES
A system tile represents an area of the galaxy. Players place system tiles during setup to create the game board.

<!-- 88.1 -->
The back of each system tile is colored green, blue, or red.

<!-- 88.2 -->
System tiles with a green-colored back are home systems and faction-specific tiles. Each home system is unique to one of the game’s factions.

<!-- 88.3 -->
System tiles with a blue-colored back each contain one or more planets.

<!-- 88.4 -->
System tiles with a red-colored back are anomalies or are systems that do not contain planets.

<!-- 88.5 -->
Planets are located in systems. Ground forces and structures are usually placed on planets.

<!-- 88.6 -->
Any area on a system tile that is not a planet is space. Ships are usually placed in the space area.

<!-- 88.7 -->
Double-sided tiles that have lines crossing from one edge to another are hyperlane tiles. Hyperlane tiles are not systems.


<!-- 89 -->
TACTICAL ACTION
The tactical action is the primary method by which players produce units, move ships, and extend their dominion within the galaxy. To perform a tactical action, the active player performs the following steps:

<!-- 89.1 -->
STEP 1—ACTIVATION: The active player must activate a system that does not contain one of their command tokens.
a To activate a system, the active player places a command token from their tactic pool in that system. That system is the active system.
b Other players’ command tokens do not prevent a player from activating a system.


<!-- 89.2 -->
STEP 2—MOVEMENT: The active player may move any number of ships that have a sufficient move value from any number of systems that do not contain one of their command tokens into the active system, following the rules for movement.
a Ships that have capacity values can transport ground forces and fighters when moving.
b The player may choose to not move any ships.
c After the “Move Ships” step, all players can use the “Space Cannon” abilities of their units in the active system.

<!-- 89.3 -->
STEP 3—SPACE COMBAT: If two players have ships in the active system, those players must resolve a space combat.
a If the active player is the only player with ships in the system, they skip this step.

<!-- 89.4 -->
STEP 4—INVASION: The active player may use their “Bombardment” abilities, commit units to land on planets, and resolve ground combat against other players’ units.

<!-- 89.5 -->
STEP 5—PRODUCTION: The active player may resolve each of their unit’s “Production” abilities in the active system.
a The active player may do this even if they did not move units or land ground forces during this tactical action.


<!-- 90 -->
TECHNOLOGY
Technology cards allow players to upgrade units and acquire powerful abilities.

<!-- 90.1 -->
Each player places any technology they have gained faceup near their faction sheet. For the duration of the game, they own any technology cards they gain and can use the abilities on those cards.

<!-- 90.2 -->
A player does not own any technology card that is in their technology deck.

<!-- 90.3 -->
A player can gain a technology card from their technology deck by researching technology.
a Both the primary and secondary abilities of the “Technology” strategy card allow a player to research a technology.

<!-- 90.4 -->
Any technology card that a player has not gained remains in their technology deck. A player can look through their technology deck at any time.


<!-- 90.5 -->
If an ability instructs a player to gain a technology, they do not research it; they take it from their technology deck and place it in their play area, ignoring prerequisites.

<!-- 90.6 -->
Some technologies are unit upgrades. Unit upgrades share a name with a unit that is printed on a player’s faction sheet.
a Players place any unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.

<!-- 90.7 -->
Each technology that is not a unit upgrade has a colored symbol displayed in the lower-right corner of the card and on its card back that indicates that technology’s color.
a A technology’s color has no inherent game effect; however, each technology a player owns can satisfy a prerequisite of a matching color when researching other technology.
b Unit upgrades do not have a color and do not satisfy prerequisites.
c There are four colors of technologies as follows:

* Biotic
* Warfare
* Propulsion
* Cybernetic


<!-- 90.8 -->
Most technology cards have a column of colored symbols displayed in the lower-left corner of the card. Each symbol in this column is a prerequisite.
a A technology card’s prerequisites indicate the number and color of technologies a player must own to research that technology card.


<!-- 90.9 -->
RESEARCHING TECHNOLOGY
A player can research technology by resolving either the primary or secondary ability of the “Technology” strategy card during the action phase. Other game effects may also instruct a player to research technology.

<!-- 90.10 -->
To research technology, a player gains that technology card from their technology deck and places it in their play area near their faction sheet.
a Players place any unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.

<!-- 90.11 -->
A player cannot research a faction technology that does not match their faction.


<!-- 90.12 -->
When researching technology, a player must satisfy each of a technology’s prerequisites to research it. To satisfy a technology’s prerequisites, that player must own one technology of the matching color for each prerequisite symbol on the technology card they wish to research.
a Prerequisites symbols are displayed as symbols on the lower-left corner of the card.
b Unit upgrade technologies do not have a color and do not satisfy prerequisites.
c Players may use certain abilities or technology specialties to ignore some prerequisites.

<!-- 90.13 -->
TECHNOLOGY SPECIALTIES
A technology specialty is a technology symbol found on some planets.

<!-- 90.14 -->
When researching technology, a player can exhaust a planet they control that has a technology specialty to ignore one prerequisite symbol of the matching type on the technology card they are researching.

<!-- 90.15 -->
If the planet card is already exhausted, it cannot be used to ignore a prerequisite.

<!-- 90.16 -->
VALEFAR ASSIMILATOR
The Nekro Virus faction can use its faction abilities in combination with its two “Valefar Assimilator” faction technologies to gain faction technologies that have been researched by other players, including unit upgrades.

<!-- 90.17 -->
Basic units printed on faction sheets are not technologies and are not eligible targets for “Valefar Assimilator.”

<!-- 90.18 -->
If a player becomes eliminated while one of their technologies has a Valefar Assimilator token on it, the Nekro Virus player places that technology in their play area; it is not removed from the game.

<!-- 90.19 -->
If a Valefar Assimilator token is removed from the Saar “Floating Factory” unit upgrade, each of the Nekro Virus’ space docks must be placed on an eligible planet they control in that space dock’s system, or the space dock is returned to their reinforcements.

<!-- 90.20 -->
If a Valefar Assimilator token is removed from a war sun unit upgrade and the Nekro Virus player does not have the standard war sun unit upgrade, each of the Nekro Virus player’s war suns are returned to their reinforcements.

<!-- 90.21 -->
The Nekro Virus player may upgrade their units with units of the same type (e.g., “dreadnought” or “infantry”) even if those unit’s names do not match. If the Nekro Virus gains a unit upgrade technology of the same unit type as a unit upgrade technology they already have, the previous upgrade is removed, and they must use the same Valefar Assimilator token that was used to copy the previous upgrade.


<!-- 90.22 -->
When a Valefar Assimilator token is on a technology, that technology’s color and type count toward objectives.


<!-- 91 -->
TECHNOLOGY (STRATEGY CARD)
The “Technology” strategy card allows players to research new technology. This card’s initiative value is “7.”

<!-- 91.1 -->
During the action phase, if the active player has the “Technology” strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card’s primary ability.

<!-- 91.2 -->
To resolve the primary ability on the “Technology” strategy card, the active player can research one technology of their choice. Then, they may research one additional technology of their choice by spending six resources.

<!-- 91.3 -->
After the active player resolves the primary ability of the “Technology” strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may research one technology of their choice by spending one command token from their strategy pool and four resources.


<!-- 92 -->
TRADE (STRATEGY CARD)
The “Trade” strategy card allows players to gain trade goods and replenish commodities. This card’s initiative value is “5.”

<!-- 92.1 -->
During the action phase, if the active player has the “Trade” strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card’s primary ability. To resolve the primary ability on the “Trade” strategy card, the active player resolves the following effects in order:

<!-- 92.2 -->
STEP 1—The active player gains 3 trade goods.

<!-- 92.3 -->
STEP 2—The active player replenishes their commodities by taking the number of commodity tokens necessary to have an amount equal to the commodity value on their faction sheet. Then, they place those tokens in the commodity area of their faction sheet.
a A player cannot have more commodities than the commodity value printed on their faction sheet.

<!-- 92.4 -->
STEP 3—The active player chooses any number of other players. Those players use the secondary ability of this card without spending a command token.

a The chosen players must resolve the secondary ability of this card without spending a command token after the active player finishes resolving the primary ability
b The chosen players can only use the secondary ability once, and they cannot use it by spending command tokens.

<!-- 92.5 -->
After the active player resolves the primary ability of the “Trade” strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from their strategy pool to replenish their commodities.


<!-- 93 -->
TRADE GOODS
A trade good represents a player’s buying and trading power beyond their planet’s raw resources.

<!-- 93.1 -->
Trade goods and commodities are represented by opposite sides of the same token.

<!-- 93.2 -->
When a player gains a trade good, they take a trade good token from the supply and place it on the trade good area on their command sheet, making sure the trade good side is faceup.

<!-- 93.3 -->
A player can spend trade goods at any time during the game.

<!-- 93.4 -->
A player can spend a trade good in one of the following ways:
a In place of spending one resource.
b In place of spending one influence. However, trade goods cannot be spent to cast votes during the agenda phase.
c To resolve an effect that specifically requires that a trade good be spent.

<!-- 93.5 -->
A player can exchange their trade goods with other players during a transaction.

<!-- 93.6 -->
When a player receives a commodity token from another player, the player who received that token places it in their trade good area with the trade good side of the token faceup. a That token is no longer a commodity token; it is a trade good token.

<!-- 93.7 -->
Trade good tokens come in values of one and three. A player can swap between these tokens as necessary.


<!-- 94 -->
TRANSACTIONS
A transaction is a way for a player to exchange commodities, trade goods, promissory notes, and relic fragments.

<!-- 94.1 -->
During the active player’s turn, they may resolve up to one transaction with each of their neighbors.
a A player can resolve a transaction at any time during their turn, even during a combat.


<!-- 94.2 -->
To resolve a transaction, a player gives any number of trade goods and commodities and up to one promissory note to a neighbor in exchange for any number of trade goods, commodities, and relic fragments, and up to one promissory note.

<!-- 94.3 -->
Players can exchange commodities, trade goods, promissory notes, and relic fragments, but cannot exchange other types of cards or tokens.
a The Emirates of Hacan can also exchange action cards with other players as part of their transactions.

<!-- 94.4 -->
A transaction does not have to be even. A player may exchange components of unequal value or give components without receiving something in return.
a The players agree on the terms of the transaction before exchanging any components. After the components are traded, the transaction cannot be undone.

<!-- 94.5 -->
Players can resolve a transaction as part of a deal.

<!-- 94.6 -->
While resolving each agenda during the agenda phase, a player may perform one transaction with each other player.
a Players do not need to be neighbors to perform these transactions.


<!-- 95 -->
TRANSPORT
When a ship moves, it may transport any combination of fighters and ground forces, but the number of units it transports cannot exceed that ship’s capacity value.

<!-- 95.1 -->
The ship can pick up and transport fighters and ground forces when it moves. During a tactical action, it can pick up and transport units from the active system, the system it started its movement in, and each system it moves through.
a These transported units remain with the transporting ship until it is finished moving.
b Units being transported by a ship that is removed from the board by a gravity rift are also removed from the board.

<!-- 95.2 -->
Any fighters and ground forces that a ship transports must move with the ship and remain in the space area of a system.

<!-- 95.3 -->
Fighters and ground forces cannot be picked up from a system that contains one of their faction’s command tokens other than the active system.

<!-- 95.4 -->
A player can land ground forces on a planet in a system during the “Invasion” step of a tactical action.


<!-- 96 -->
UNITS
A unit is represented by a plastic figure.

<!-- 96.1 -->
There are three types of units: ships, ground forces, and structures.

<!-- 96.2 -->
Each color of plastic comes with the following units:

* 3 Space Docks
* 6 PDS units
* 8 Destroyers
* 8 Cruisers
* 2 War Suns
* 12 Infantry
* 10 Fighters
* 4 Carriers
* 5 Dreadnoughts
* 1 Flagship
* 4 Mechs

<!-- 96.3 -->
Units exist either on the game board or in a player’s reinforcements.


<!-- 97 -->
UNIT UPGRADES
A unit upgrade is a type of technology card.

<!-- 97.1 -->
Unit upgrades share a name with a unit that is printed on a player’s faction sheet, but have a higher roman numeral. For example, a player’s “Carrier I” unit is upgraded by the unit upgrade technology “Carrier II.”
a The Nekro Virus player may upgrade their units with units of the same type (e.g., “dreadnought” or “infantry”) even if those unit’s names do not match. If the Nekro Virus gains a unit upgrade technology of the same unit type as a unit upgrade technology they already have, the previous upgrade is removed, and they must use the same Valefar Assimilator token that was used to copy the previous upgrade.

<!-- 97.2 -->
Players place unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.

<!-- 97.3 -->
The white arrows next to an attribute on a faction sheet indicate that the attribute will improve when the unit is upgraded.

<!-- 97.4 -->
After a player gains a unit upgrade card, each of that player’s units that correspond to that upgrade card is treated as having the attributes and abilities printed on that upgrade card. Any previous attributes of that unit, such as the one printed on that player’s faction sheet, are ignored.

<!-- 97.5 -->
A mech unit card is not a technology.


<!-- 98 -->
VICTORY POINTS
The first player to gain 10 victory points wins the game.

<!-- 98.1 -->
Players gain victory points in a variety of ways. A common way that a player can gain victory points is by scoring objectives.

<!-- 98.2 -->
Each player uses the victory point track to indicate the number of victory points they have gained.
a If the players are using the 14-space side of the victory point track, the game ends and a player wins when they have 14 victory points instead of 10.

<!-- 98.3 -->
Each player places one of their control tokens on space “0” of the victory point track during setup.

<!-- 98.4 -->
When a player gains a victory point, they advance their control token a number of spaces along the victory point track equal to the number of victory points gained.
a A player’s control token must always be on the space of the victory point track that shows a number that matches the number of victory points that player has gained during the game. A player cannot have more than 10 victory points.

<!-- 98.5 -->
If an ability refers to the player with the “most” or “fewest” victory points, and more than one player is tied in that respect, the effect applies to all of the tied players.

<!-- 98.6 -->
If a player gains a victory point from a law, and that law is discarded, that player does not lose that victory point.

<!-- 98.7 -->
The game ends immediately when one player has 10 victory points. If multiple players would simultaneously gain their 10th victory point, the player who is earliest in initiative order among those players is the winner; if this occurs when players do not have strategy cards, the player who is nearest the speaker (including the speaker) in clockwise order is the winner.

<!-- 98.8 -->
If the game ends because the speaker cannot reveal an objective card, the player with the most victory points is the winner. If one or more players are tied for having the most victory points, the tied player who is first in initiative order is the winner. 


<!-- 99 -->
WARFARE (STRATEGY CARD)
The “Warfare” strategy card allows a player to remove a command token from the board and redistribute their command tokens between their tactic, fleet, and strategy pools. This card’s initiative value is “6.” During the action phase, if the active player has the “Warfare” strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card’s primary ability. To resolve the primary ability on the “Warfare” strategy card, the
active player performs the following steps:

<!-- 99.1 -->
STEP 1—The active player removes any one of their command tokens from the game board. Then, that player gains that command token by placing it in a pool of their choice on their command sheet.


<!-- 99.2 -->
STEP 2—The active player can redistribute their command tokens.

<!-- 99.3 -->
After the active player resolves the primary ability of the “Warfare” strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from their strategy pool to resolve the “Production” ability of one space dock in their home system. a The command token is not placed in their home system.


<!-- 100 -->
WORMHOLE NEXUS
The wormhole nexus is a system tile where several wormholes converge.

<!-- 100.1 -->
The wormhole nexus begins the game in play with its inactive side up.
a The inactive side of the wormhole nexus contains a gamma wormhole. The active side of the wormhole nexus contains an alpha, beta, and gamma wormhole.
b The wormhole nexus is treated as part of the game board.
c The wormhole nexus is on the edge of the game board.

<!-- 100.2 -->
After a player moves or places a unit into the wormhole nexus, or gains control of the planet Mallice, that player flips the wormhole nexus to its active side.
a When a ship moves into the wormhole nexus, the nexus becomes active at the end of the “Movement” step.


<!-- 101 -->
WORMHOLES
Some systems contain wormholes. Systems that contain identical wormholes are adjacent.

<!-- 101.1 -->
There are two basic types of wormholes: alpha and beta.

<!-- 101.2 -->
If a player has a PDS unit upgrade technology, they can use the “Space Cannon” abilities of their PDS units through wormholes.

<!-- 101.3 -->
Players can be neighbors and perform transactions through wormholes.

<!-- 101.4 -->
There are two advanced types of wormhole: delta and gamma. These wormholes follow all other wormhole rules.
a The delta wormholes are present on the Creuss Gate system tile and the Ghosts of Creuss home system tile.
b The gamma wormholes are present on the wormhole nexus and can be discovered during exploration
