<!-- 80 -->
SPEAKER
The speaker is the player who has the speaker token.

<!-- 80.1 -->
During the strategy phase, the speaker is the first player to choose a strategy card.

<!-- 80.2 -->
During the agenda phase, the speaker reveals the top agenda card from the agenda deck before each vote. The speaker is always the last player to vote and decides which outcome to resolve if the outcomes are tied.

<!-- 80.3 -->
During setup, the speaker prepares the objectives.

<!-- 80.4 -->
During the status phase, the speaker reveals a public objective.

<!-- 80.5 -->
A random player gains the speaker token during setup before the game begins.

<!-- 80.6 -->
During the action phase, if a player resolves the primary ability on the “Politics” strategy card, that player chooses any player other than the current speaker to gain the speaker token.

<!-- 80.7 -->
If the speaker is eliminated from the game, the speaker token is passed to the player to the speaker’s left.


<!-- 81 -->
STATUS PHASE
During the status phase, players score objectives and prepare for the next game round. To resolve the status phase, players perform the following steps:

<!-- 81.1 -->
STEP 1—SCORE OBJECTIVES: Following initiative order, each player may score up to one public objective and one secret objective that can be fulfilled during the status phase. To score an objective, a player must fulfill the requirements on the card; if that player does, they gain a number of victory points indicated on the card.

<!-- 81.2 -->
STEP 2—REVEAL PUBLIC OBJECTIVE: The speaker reveals an unrevealed public objective card by flipping that card faceup.
a The speaker cannot reveal “Stage II” objectives until all “Stage I” objectives are revealed.
b The game ends if there are no unrevealed public objectives at the start of this step.

<!-- 81.3 -->
STEP 3—DRAW ACTION CARDS: Following initiative order, each player draws one action card.

<!-- 81.4 -->
STEP 4—REMOVE COMMAND TOKENS: Each player removes all of their command tokens from the game board. Each player returns each removed token to their reinforcements.

<!-- 81.5 -->
STEP 5—GAIN AND REDISTRIBUTE COMMAND TOKENS: Each player gains two command tokens. A player takes each gained token from their reinforcements. Then, each player can redistribute each command token on their command sheet, including the two they just gained, among their strategy, tactic, and fleet pools.
a Players should remember to check the number of their ships in each system after reducing the size of their fleet pools.
b This step can usually be resolved simultaneously, but if there is a timing conflict, it is resolved in initiative order.


<!-- 81.6 -->
STEP 6—READY CARDS: Each player readies all of their exhausted cards, including strategy cards.

<!-- 81.7 -->
STEP 7—REPAIR UNITS: Each player repairs all of their damaged units by turning those units upright.

<!-- 81.8 -->
STEP 8—RETURN STRATEGY CARDS: Each player returns their strategy card to the common play area. Then, if a player has removed the custodians token from Mecatol Rex, the game round continues to the agenda phase. Otherwise, a new game round begins with the strategy phase.


<!-- 82 -->
STRATEGIC ACTION
During the action phase, the active player may perform a strategic action to resolve the primary ability on their strategy card.

<!-- 82.1 -->
After the active player resolves the primary ability on their strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may resolve that strategy card’s secondary ability.
a Players do not have to resolve the secondary abilities of the active player’s strategy card.

<!-- 82.2 -->
After each player has had an opportunity to resolve a strategy card’s secondary ability, the active player exhausts their strategy card so that it is facedown—this indicates that they cannot use this card again this round and is a reminder that they can now pass during one of their later turns.
a During three- and four-player games, a player must resolve the strategic action on each of their chosen strategy cards before they can pass.

<!-- 82.3 -->
When a player is resolving either the primary or secondary abilities from a strategy card, that player resolves each of the ability’s effects from top to bottom.


<!-- 83 -->
STRATEGY CARD
Strategy cards determine initiative order and provide each player with a powerful ability that they can use one time during the action phase.

<!-- 83.1 -->
During the strategy phase, each player chooses a strategy card from the common play area and places it in their play area faceup.

<!-- 83.2 -->
Each strategy card has a readied and an exhausted side.

a The readied side contains the strategy card’s name, initiative number, and abilities.
b The exhausted side contains the strategy card’s initiative number.

<!-- 83.3 -->
A player can only resolve the primary ability of their own strategy cards.

<!-- 83.4 -->
A player can only resolve the secondary ability of strategy cards that were chosen by other players.

<!-- 83.5 -->
There are eight strategy cards, each of which has a name and an initiative number.

<!-- 83.6 -->
The initiative number on a player’s strategy card determines the initiative order for the action phase and status phase.

<!-- 83.7 -->
A strategy card has both a primary ability and a secondary ability. These abilities are resolved during a strategic action.

<!-- 83.8 -->
Each strategy card exists in either the common play area or a player’s play area.
a Strategy cards in the common play area are available for players to choose during the strategy phase.
b A strategy card in a player’s play area belongs to that player until it is returned to the common play area during the status phase.


<!-- 84 -->
STRATEGY PHASE
During the strategy phase, each player chooses a strategy card to use during the round.

To resolve the strategy phase, players perform the following steps:

<!-- 84.1 -->
STEP 1—Starting with the speaker and proceeding clockwise, each player chooses one strategy card from the common play area and places it faceup in their play area.
a If there are one or more trade good tokens on a strategy card when a player chooses it, that player gains those trade goods.
b A player cannot choose a strategy card that another player has already chosen during the current strategy phase.
c When playing with three or four players, each player will choose a second strategy card. After the last player has received their first strategy card, each player chooses
a second strategy card, starting with the speaker and proceeding clockwise.

<!-- 84.2 -->
STEP 2—The speaker places one trade good token from the supply on each strategy card that was not chosen.

a During a four- or eight-player game, all strategy cards will be chosen, and therefore no trade good tokens will be placed on strategy cards. Then, players proceed to the action phase.


<!-- 85 -->
STRUCTURES
A structure is a type of unit. PDS units and space docks are structures.

<!-- 85.1 -->
Structures are always placed on planets.
a The Clan of Saar’s “Floating Factory” faction-specific space dock is placed in a system’s space area.

<!-- 85.2 -->
Structures are primarily placed on planets using the “Construction” strategy card.

<!-- 85.3 -->
Structures cannot move or be transported.

<!-- 85.4 -->
A player can have a maximum of one space dock on each planet.

<!-- 85.5 -->
A player can have a maximum of two PDS units on each planet.

<!-- 85.6 -->
A player cannot place a structure on a planet if it would exceed the maximum number of allowed structures of that type on that planet.


<!-- 86 -->
SUPERNOVA
A supernova is an anomaly that affects movement.

<!-- 86.1 -->
A ship cannot move through or into a supernova.


<!-- 87 -->
SUSTAIN DAMAGE (UNIT ABILITY)
Some units have the “Sustain Damage” ability. Immediately before a player assigns hits to their units, that player can use the “Sustain Damage” ability of any of their units in the active system.

<!-- 87.1 -->
For each “Sustain Damage” ability that a player uses, one hit produced by another player’s units is canceled. Then, each unit using this ability is placed on its side to indicate that it is damaged.

<!-- 87.2 -->
A damaged unit does not have reduced capabilities and is functionally the same as an undamaged unit, except that it cannot use the “Sustain Damage” ability.

<!-- 87.3 -->
A damaged unit cannot use the “Sustain Damage” ability until it is repaired during the status phase or by another game effect.


<!-- 87.4 -->
A unit can use its “Sustain Damage” ability any time a hit is produced against it. This includes hits produced during combat and from unit abilities such as the “Space Cannon” ability.
a A unit can only use the “Sustain Damage” ability if it is eligible to be hit. For example, a player cannot use a dreadnought’s “Sustain Damage” ability to cancel a hit from “Anti-Fighter Barrage.”

<!-- 87.5 -->
The “Sustain Damage” ability cannot be used to cancel an effect that directly destroys a unit.

<!-- 87.6 -->
The Barony of Letnev’s “Non-Euclidean Shielding” faction technology allows the Letnev player’s units with the “Sustain Damage” ability to cancel up to two hits instead of one.


<!-- 88 -->
SYSTEM TILES
A system tile represents an area of the galaxy. Players place system tiles during setup to create the game board.

<!-- 88.1 -->
The back of each system tile is colored green, blue, or red.

<!-- 88.2 -->
System tiles with a green-colored back are home systems and faction-specific tiles. Each home system is unique to one of the game’s factions.

<!-- 88.3 -->
System tiles with a blue-colored back each contain one or more planets.

<!-- 88.4 -->
System tiles with a red-colored back are anomalies or are systems that do not contain planets.

<!-- 88.5 -->
Planets are located in systems. Ground forces and structures are usually placed on planets.

<!-- 88.6 -->
Any area on a system tile that is not a planet is space. Ships are usually placed in the space area.

<!-- 88.7 -->
Double-sided tiles that have lines crossing from one edge to another are hyperlane tiles. Hyperlane tiles are not systems.


<!-- 89 -->
TACTICAL ACTION
The tactical action is the primary method by which players produce units, move ships, and extend their dominion within the galaxy. To perform a tactical action, the active player performs the following steps:

<!-- 89.1 -->
STEP 1—ACTIVATION: The active player must activate a system that does not contain one of their command tokens.
a To activate a system, the active player places a command token from their tactic pool in that system. That system is the active system.
b Other players’ command tokens do not prevent a player from activating a system.


<!-- 89.2 -->
STEP 2—MOVEMENT: The active player may move any number of ships that have a sufficient move value from any number of systems that do not contain one of their command tokens into the active system, following the rules for movement.
a Ships that have capacity values can transport ground forces and fighters when moving.
b The player may choose to not move any ships.
c After the “Move Ships” step, all players can use the “Space Cannon” abilities of their units in the active system.

<!-- 89.3 -->
STEP 3—SPACE COMBAT: If two players have ships in the active system, those players must resolve a space combat.
a If the active player is the only player with ships in the system, they skip this step.

<!-- 89.4 -->
STEP 4—INVASION: The active player may use their “Bombardment” abilities, commit units to land on planets, and resolve ground combat against other players’ units.

<!-- 89.5 -->
STEP 5—PRODUCTION: The active player may resolve each of their unit’s “Production” abilities in the active system.
a The active player may do this even if they did not move units or land ground forces during this tactical action.


<!-- 90 -->
TECHNOLOGY
Technology cards allow players to upgrade units and acquire powerful abilities.

<!-- 90.1 -->
Each player places any technology they have gained faceup near their faction sheet. For the duration of the game, they own any technology cards they gain and can use the abilities on those cards.

<!-- 90.2 -->
A player does not own any technology card that is in their technology deck.

<!-- 90.3 -->
A player can gain a technology card from their technology deck by researching technology.
a Both the primary and secondary abilities of the “Technology” strategy card allow a player to research a technology.

<!-- 90.4 -->
Any technology card that a player has not gained remains in their technology deck. A player can look through their technology deck at any time.


<!-- 90.5 -->
If an ability instructs a player to gain a technology, they do not research it; they take it from their technology deck and place it in their play area, ignoring prerequisites.

<!-- 90.6 -->
Some technologies are unit upgrades. Unit upgrades share a name with a unit that is printed on a player’s faction sheet.
a Players place any unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.

<!-- 90.7 -->
Each technology that is not a unit upgrade has a colored symbol displayed in the lower-right corner of the card and on its card back that indicates that technology’s color.
a A technology’s color has no inherent game effect; however, each technology a player owns can satisfy a prerequisite of a matching color when researching other technology.
b Unit upgrades do not have a color and do not satisfy prerequisites.
c There are four colors of technologies as follows:

* Biotic
* Warfare
* Propulsion
* Cybernetic


<!-- 90.8 -->
Most technology cards have a column of colored symbols displayed in the lower-left corner of the card. Each symbol in this column is a prerequisite.
a A technology card’s prerequisites indicate the number and color of technologies a player must own to research that technology card.


<!-- 90.9 -->
RESEARCHING TECHNOLOGY
A player can research technology by resolving either the primary or secondary ability of the “Technology” strategy card during the action phase. Other game effects may also instruct a player to research technology.

<!-- 90.10 -->
To research technology, a player gains that technology card from their technology deck and places it in their play area near their faction sheet.
a Players place any unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.

<!-- 90.11 -->
A player cannot research a faction technology that does not match their faction.


<!-- 90.12 -->
When researching technology, a player must satisfy each of a technology’s prerequisites to research it. To satisfy a technology’s prerequisites, that player must own one technology of the matching color for each prerequisite symbol on the technology card they wish to research.
a Prerequisites symbols are displayed as symbols on the lower-left corner of the card.
b Unit upgrade technologies do not have a color and do not satisfy prerequisites.
c Players may use certain abilities or technology specialties to ignore some prerequisites.

<!-- 90.13 -->
TECHNOLOGY SPECIALTIES
A technology specialty is a technology symbol found on some planets.

<!-- 90.14 -->
When researching technology, a player can exhaust a planet they control that has a technology specialty to ignore one prerequisite symbol of the matching type on the technology card they are researching.

<!-- 90.15 -->
If the planet card is already exhausted, it cannot be used to ignore a prerequisite.

<!-- 90.16 -->
VALEFAR ASSIMILATOR
The Nekro Virus faction can use its faction abilities in combination with its two “Valefar Assimilator” faction technologies to gain faction technologies that have been researched by other players, including unit upgrades.

<!-- 90.17 -->
Basic units printed on faction sheets are not technologies and are not eligible targets for “Valefar Assimilator.”

<!-- 90.18 -->
If a player becomes eliminated while one of their technologies has a Valefar Assimilator token on it, the Nekro Virus player places that technology in their play area; it is not removed from the game.

<!-- 90.19 -->
If a Valefar Assimilator token is removed from the Saar “Floating Factory” unit upgrade, each of the Nekro Virus’ space docks must be placed on an eligible planet they control in that space dock’s system, or the space dock is returned to their reinforcements.

<!-- 90.20 -->
If a Valefar Assimilator token is removed from a war sun unit upgrade and the Nekro Virus player does not have the standard war sun unit upgrade, each of the Nekro Virus player’s war suns are returned to their reinforcements.

<!-- 90.21 -->
The Nekro Virus player may upgrade their units with units of the same type (e.g., “dreadnought” or “infantry”) even if those unit’s names do not match. If the Nekro Virus gains a unit upgrade technology of the same unit type as a unit upgrade technology they already have, the previous upgrade is removed, and they must use the same Valefar Assimilator token that was used to copy the previous upgrade.


<!-- 90.22 -->
When a Valefar Assimilator token is on a technology, that technology’s color and type count toward objectives.


<!-- 91 -->
TECHNOLOGY (STRATEGY CARD)
The “Technology” strategy card allows players to research new technology. This card’s initiative value is “7.”

<!-- 91.1 -->
During the action phase, if the active player has the “Technology” strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card’s primary ability.

<!-- 91.2 -->
To resolve the primary ability on the “Technology” strategy card, the active player can research one technology of their choice. Then, they may research one additional technology of their choice by spending six resources.

<!-- 91.3 -->
After the active player resolves the primary ability of the “Technology” strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may research one technology of their choice by spending one command token from their strategy pool and four resources.


<!-- 92 -->
TRADE (STRATEGY CARD)
The “Trade” strategy card allows players to gain trade goods and replenish commodities. This card’s initiative value is “5.”

<!-- 92.1 -->
During the action phase, if the active player has the “Trade” strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card’s primary ability. To resolve the primary ability on the “Trade” strategy card, the active player resolves the following effects in order:

<!-- 92.2 -->
STEP 1—The active player gains 3 trade goods.

<!-- 92.3 -->
STEP 2—The active player replenishes their commodities by taking the number of commodity tokens necessary to have an amount equal to the commodity value on their faction sheet. Then, they place those tokens in the commodity area of their faction sheet.
a A player cannot have more commodities than the commodity value printed on their faction sheet.

<!-- 92.4 -->
STEP 3—The active player chooses any number of other players. Those players use the secondary ability of this card without spending a command token.

a The chosen players must resolve the secondary ability of this card without spending a command token after the active player finishes resolving the primary ability
b The chosen players can only use the secondary ability once, and they cannot use it by spending command tokens.

<!-- 92.5 -->
After the active player resolves the primary ability of the “Trade” strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from their strategy pool to replenish their commodities.


<!-- 93 -->
TRADE GOODS
A trade good represents a player’s buying and trading power beyond their planet’s raw resources.

<!-- 93.1 -->
Trade goods and commodities are represented by opposite sides of the same token.

<!-- 93.2 -->
When a player gains a trade good, they take a trade good token from the supply and place it on the trade good area on their command sheet, making sure the trade good side is faceup.

<!-- 93.3 -->
A player can spend trade goods at any time during the game.

<!-- 93.4 -->
A player can spend a trade good in one of the following ways:
a In place of spending one resource.
b In place of spending one influence. However, trade goods cannot be spent to cast votes during the agenda phase.
c To resolve an effect that specifically requires that a trade good be spent.

<!-- 93.5 -->
A player can exchange their trade goods with other players during a transaction.

<!-- 93.6 -->
When a player receives a commodity token from another player, the player who received that token places it in their trade good area with the trade good side of the token faceup. a That token is no longer a commodity token; it is a trade good token.

<!-- 93.7 -->
Trade good tokens come in values of one and three. A player can swap between these tokens as necessary.


<!-- 94 -->
TRANSACTIONS
A transaction is a way for a player to exchange commodities, trade goods, promissory notes, and relic fragments.

<!-- 94.1 -->
During the active player’s turn, they may resolve up to one transaction with each of their neighbors.
a A player can resolve a transaction at any time during their turn, even during a combat.


<!-- 94.2 -->
To resolve a transaction, a player gives any number of trade goods and commodities and up to one promissory note to a neighbor in exchange for any number of trade goods, commodities, and relic fragments, and up to one promissory note.

<!-- 94.3 -->
Players can exchange commodities, trade goods, promissory notes, and relic fragments, but cannot exchange other types of cards or tokens.
a The Emirates of Hacan can also exchange action cards with other players as part of their transactions.

<!-- 94.4 -->
A transaction does not have to be even. A player may exchange components of unequal value or give components without receiving something in return.
a The players agree on the terms of the transaction before exchanging any components. After the components are traded, the transaction cannot be undone.

<!-- 94.5 -->
Players can resolve a transaction as part of a deal.

<!-- 94.6 -->
While resolving each agenda during the agenda phase, a player may perform one transaction with each other player.
a Players do not need to be neighbors to perform these transactions.


<!-- 95 -->
TRANSPORT
When a ship moves, it may transport any combination of fighters and ground forces, but the number of units it transports cannot exceed that ship’s capacity value.

<!-- 95.1 -->
The ship can pick up and transport fighters and ground forces when it moves. During a tactical action, it can pick up and transport units from the active system, the system it started its movement in, and each system it moves through.
a These transported units remain with the transporting ship until it is finished moving.
b Units being transported by a ship that is removed from the board by a gravity rift are also removed from the board.

<!-- 95.2 -->
Any fighters and ground forces that a ship transports must move with the ship and remain in the space area of a system.

<!-- 95.3 -->
Fighters and ground forces cannot be picked up from a system that contains one of their faction’s command tokens other than the active system.

<!-- 95.4 -->
A player can land ground forces on a planet in a system during the “Invasion” step of a tactical action.


<!-- 96 -->
UNITS
A unit is represented by a plastic figure.

<!-- 96.1 -->
There are three types of units: ships, ground forces, and structures.

<!-- 96.2 -->
Each color of plastic comes with the following units:

* 3 Space Docks
* 6 PDS units
* 8 Destroyers
* 8 Cruisers
* 2 War Suns
* 12 Infantry
* 10 Fighters
* 4 Carriers
* 5 Dreadnoughts
* 1 Flagship
* 4 Mechs

<!-- 96.3 -->
Units exist either on the game board or in a player’s reinforcements.


<!-- 97 -->
UNIT UPGRADES
A unit upgrade is a type of technology card.

<!-- 97.1 -->
Unit upgrades share a name with a unit that is printed on a player’s faction sheet, but have a higher roman numeral. For example, a player’s “Carrier I” unit is upgraded by the unit upgrade technology “Carrier II.”
a The Nekro Virus player may upgrade their units with units of the same type (e.g., “dreadnought” or “infantry”) even if those unit’s names do not match. If the Nekro Virus gains a unit upgrade technology of the same unit type as a unit upgrade technology they already have, the previous upgrade is removed, and they must use the same Valefar Assimilator token that was used to copy the previous upgrade.

<!-- 97.2 -->
Players place unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.

<!-- 97.3 -->
The white arrows next to an attribute on a faction sheet indicate that the attribute will improve when the unit is upgraded.

<!-- 97.4 -->
After a player gains a unit upgrade card, each of that player’s units that correspond to that upgrade card is treated as having the attributes and abilities printed on that upgrade card. Any previous attributes of that unit, such as the one printed on that player’s faction sheet, are ignored.

<!-- 97.5 -->
A mech unit card is not a technology.


<!-- 98 -->
VICTORY POINTS
The first player to gain 10 victory points wins the game.

<!-- 98.1 -->
Players gain victory points in a variety of ways. A common way that a player can gain victory points is by scoring objectives.

<!-- 98.2 -->
Each player uses the victory point track to indicate the number of victory points they have gained.
a If the players are using the 14-space side of the victory point track, the game ends and a player wins when they have 14 victory points instead of 10.

<!-- 98.3 -->
Each player places one of their control tokens on space “0” of the victory point track during setup.

<!-- 98.4 -->
When a player gains a victory point, they advance their control token a number of spaces along the victory point track equal to the number of victory points gained.
a A player’s control token must always be on the space of the victory point track that shows a number that matches the number of victory points that player has gained during the game. A player cannot have more than 10 victory points.

<!-- 98.5 -->
If an ability refers to the player with the “most” or “fewest” victory points, and more than one player is tied in that respect, the effect applies to all of the tied players.

<!-- 98.6 -->
If a player gains a victory point from a law, and that law is discarded, that player does not lose that victory point.

<!-- 98.7 -->
The game ends immediately when one player has 10 victory points. If multiple players would simultaneously gain their 10th victory point, the player who is earliest in initiative order among those players is the winner; if this occurs when players do not have strategy cards, the player who is nearest the speaker (including the speaker) in clockwise order is the winner.

<!-- 98.8 -->
If the game ends because the speaker cannot reveal an objective card, the player with the most victory points is the winner. If one or more players are tied for having the most victory points, the tied player who is first in initiative order is the winner. 


<!-- 99 -->
WARFARE (STRATEGY CARD)
The “Warfare” strategy card allows a player to remove a command token from the board and redistribute their command tokens between their tactic, fleet, and strategy pools. This card’s initiative value is “6.” During the action phase, if the active player has the “Warfare” strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card’s primary ability. To resolve the primary ability on the “Warfare” strategy card, the
active player performs the following steps:

<!-- 99.1 -->
STEP 1—The active player removes any one of their command tokens from the game board. Then, that player gains that command token by placing it in a pool of their choice on their command sheet.


<!-- 99.2 -->
STEP 2—The active player can redistribute their command tokens.

<!-- 99.3 -->
After the active player resolves the primary ability of the “Warfare” strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from their strategy pool to resolve the “Production” ability of one space dock in their home system. a The command token is not placed in their home system.


<!-- 100 -->
WORMHOLE NEXUS
The wormhole nexus is a system tile where several wormholes converge.

<!-- 100.1 -->
The wormhole nexus begins the game in play with its inactive side up.
a The inactive side of the wormhole nexus contains a gamma wormhole. The active side of the wormhole nexus contains an alpha, beta, and gamma wormhole.
b The wormhole nexus is treated as part of the game board.
c The wormhole nexus is on the edge of the game board.

<!-- 100.2 -->
After a player moves or places a unit into the wormhole nexus, or gains control of the planet Mallice, that player flips the wormhole nexus to its active side.
a When a ship moves into the wormhole nexus, the nexus becomes active at the end of the “Movement” step.


<!-- 101 -->
WORMHOLES
Some systems contain wormholes. Systems that contain identical wormholes are adjacent.

<!-- 101.1 -->
There are two basic types of wormholes: alpha and beta.

<!-- 101.2 -->
If a player has a PDS unit upgrade technology, they can use the “Space Cannon” abilities of their PDS units through wormholes.

<!-- 101.3 -->
Players can be neighbors and perform transactions through wormholes.

<!-- 101.4 -->
There are two advanced types of wormhole: delta and gamma. These wormholes follow all other wormhole rules.
a The delta wormholes are present on the Creuss Gate system tile and the Ghosts of Creuss home system tile.
b The gamma wormholes are present on the wormhole nexus and can be discovered during exploration
