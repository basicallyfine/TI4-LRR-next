TRANSPORT
When a ship moves, it may transport any combination of fighters and ground forces, but the number of units it transports cannot exceed that ship’s capacity value.

<!-- 95.1 -->
The ship can pick up and transport fighters and ground forces when it moves. During a tactical action, it can pick up and transport units from the active system, the system it started its movement in, and each system it moves through.
a These transported units remain with the transporting ship until it is finished moving.
b Units being transported by a ship that is removed from the board by a gravity rift are also removed from the board.

<!-- 95.2 -->
Any fighters and ground forces that a ship transports must move with the ship and remain in the space area of a system.

<!-- 95.3 -->
Fighters and ground forces cannot be picked up from a system that contains one of their faction’s command tokens other than the active system.

<!-- 95.4 -->
A player can land ground forces on a planet in a system during the “Invasion” step of a tactical action.


<!-- 96 -->
UNITS
A unit is represented by a plastic figure.

<!-- 96.1 -->
There are three types of units: ships, ground forces, and structures.

<!-- 96.2 -->
Each color of plastic comes with the following units:

* 3 Space Docks
* 6 PDS units
* 8 Destroyers
* 8 Cruisers
* 2 War Suns
* 12 Infantry
* 10 Fighters
* 4 Carriers
* 5 Dreadnoughts
* 1 Flagship
* 4 Mechs

<!-- 96.3 -->
Units exist either on the game board or in a player’s reinforcements.


<!-- 97 -->
UNIT UPGRADES
A unit upgrade is a type of technology card.

<!-- 97.1 -->
Unit upgrades share a name with a unit that is printed on a player’s faction sheet, but have a higher roman numeral. For example, a player’s “Carrier I” unit is upgraded by the unit upgrade technology “Carrier II.”
a The Nekro Virus player may upgrade their units with units of the same type (e.g., “dreadnought” or “infantry”) even if those unit’s names do not match. If the Nekro Virus gains a unit upgrade technology of the same unit type as a unit upgrade technology they already have, the previous upgrade is removed, and they must use the same Valefar Assimilator token that was used to copy the previous upgrade.

<!-- 97.2 -->
Players place unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.

<!-- 97.3 -->
The white arrows next to an attribute on a faction sheet indicate that the attribute will improve when the unit is upgraded.

<!-- 97.4 -->
After a player gains a unit upgrade card, each of that player’s units that correspond to that upgrade card is treated as having the attributes and abilities printed on that upgrade card. Any previous attributes of that unit, such as the one printed on that player’s faction sheet, are ignored.

<!-- 97.5 -->
A mech unit card is not a technology.


<!-- 98 -->
VICTORY POINTS
The first player to gain 10 victory points wins the game.

<!-- 98.1 -->
Players gain victory points in a variety of ways. A common way that a player can gain victory points is by scoring objectives.

<!-- 98.2 -->
Each player uses the victory point track to indicate the number of victory points they have gained.
a If the players are using the 14-space side of the victory point track, the game ends and a player wins when they have 14 victory points instead of 10.

<!-- 98.3 -->
Each player places one of their control tokens on space “0” of the victory point track during setup.

<!-- 98.4 -->
When a player gains a victory point, they advance their control token a number of spaces along the victory point track equal to the number of victory points gained.
a A player’s control token must always be on the space of the victory point track that shows a number that matches the number of victory points that player has gained during the game. A player cannot have more than 10 victory points.

<!-- 98.5 -->
If an ability refers to the player with the “most” or “fewest” victory points, and more than one player is tied in that respect, the effect applies to all of the tied players.

<!-- 98.6 -->
If a player gains a victory point from a law, and that law is discarded, that player does not lose that victory point.

<!-- 98.7 -->
The game ends immediately when one player has 10 victory points. If multiple players would simultaneously gain their 10th victory point, the player who is earliest in initiative order among those players is the winner; if this occurs when players do not have strategy cards, the player who is nearest the speaker (including the speaker) in clockwise order is the winner.

<!-- 98.8 -->
If the game ends because the speaker cannot reveal an objective card, the player with the most victory points is the winner. If one or more players are tied for having the most victory points, the tied player who is first in initiative order is the winner. 


<!-- 99 -->
WARFARE (STRATEGY CARD)
The “Warfare” strategy card allows a player to remove a command token from the board and redistribute their command tokens between their tactic, fleet, and strategy pools. This card’s initiative value is “6.” During the action phase, if the active player has the “Warfare” strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card’s primary ability. To resolve the primary ability on the “Warfare” strategy card, the
active player performs the following steps:

<!-- 99.1 -->
STEP 1—The active player removes any one of their command tokens from the game board. Then, that player gains that command token by placing it in a pool of their choice on their command sheet.


<!-- 99.2 -->
STEP 2—The active player can redistribute their command tokens.

<!-- 99.3 -->
After the active player resolves the primary ability of the “Warfare” strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from their strategy pool to resolve the “Production” ability of one space dock in their home system. a The command token is not placed in their home system.


<!-- 100 -->
WORMHOLE NEXUS
The wormhole nexus is a system tile where several wormholes converge.

<!-- 100.1 -->
The wormhole nexus begins the game in play with its inactive side up.
a The inactive side of the wormhole nexus contains a gamma wormhole. The active side of the wormhole nexus contains an alpha, beta, and gamma wormhole.
b The wormhole nexus is treated as part of the game board.
c The wormhole nexus is on the edge of the game board.

<!-- 100.2 -->
After a player moves or places a unit into the wormhole nexus, or gains control of the planet Mallice, that player flips the wormhole nexus to its active side.
a When a ship moves into the wormhole nexus, the nexus becomes active at the end of the “Movement” step.


<!-- 101 -->
WORMHOLES
Some systems contain wormholes. Systems that contain identical wormholes are adjacent.

<!-- 101.1 -->
There are two basic types of wormholes: alpha and beta.

<!-- 101.2 -->
If a player has a PDS unit upgrade technology, they can use the “Space Cannon” abilities of their PDS units through wormholes.

<!-- 101.3 -->
Players can be neighbors and perform transactions through wormholes.

<!-- 101.4 -->
There are two advanced types of wormhole: delta and gamma. These wormholes follow all other wormhole rules.
a The delta wormholes are present on the Creuss Gate system tile and the Ghosts of Creuss home system tile.
b The gamma wormholes are present on the wormhole nexus and can be discovered during exploration
